Testing
-------

.equals()
- every class has an equals() method, and if you don't define explicitly,
- Default: r1.equals(r2) same as r1 == r2 (if they point to same obj, reference equality)
- Many classes define equals to compare content of two objects (i.e. String)


4 degrees of equality:
----------------------
- reference equality, ==
- shallow structural equality: fields are ==
- deep structural equality: fields are equals()
- logical equality (where two things are equal from a mathematical pov)
    - ex: fractions 1/3 and 2/6. are these equal? yeah...
    - ex: "set" objects are equals if they contain the same elements, regardless of order
