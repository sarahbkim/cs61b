- How long does binary search take?
    - if array is n elements, log(n) (base 2 log)
        - n...n/2...n/4...n/8...1
        - log(billion) -> 30
    - Goodrich Thomasia 4.1.2 and 4.1.7
- Enough stack space for a few thousands of stack frames
    - but if you have a recursive algorithm that ends up being a log there will be enough space
    - else, use iterative method instead...
- Binary search works on arrays but not on linked lists!

Scope & recursion:
- scope of a var: portion of program that can access the variable
    - class var: in scope everywhere in the class except when shadowed by local vars
    - fully qualified class var (System.out) in scope in class, can't be shadowed
        if public, they're in scope in all classes
    - instance vars: in scope in non-static methods of the class, except when shadowed
    - fully qualified instance vars ("kayla.name", "this.item")
    - local vars & parameters: only in scope inside the method that defines them
        only for topmost stackframe
